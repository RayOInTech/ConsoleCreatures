# ConsoleCreatures
This is a fun project built in C# demonstrating the power of the print statements and positioning.


To execute the code load it up onto the terminal when downloaded.

From there choose your directory and then run it with either VS code or Bash.

I run it with these simple commands.

Bash Instructions:
1. Note, if the file is downloaded, it will be in the download file.
2. First check the present working directory with the command pwd.
3. Then, if located in download folder, navigate to directory with cd Downloads/
4.  Next, use the command "ls" to locate the contents of the folder to locate the file
5. Lastly, use the open /path/to/downloaded/file to open and run the file.

VS Code Instructions:
1. Make sure that .NET SDK kit is downloaded
2. Open any working workspace
3. Launch Terminal in the Editor
4. Once launched, navigate to active directory with commands cd Directory Name
5. Then check list contents with ls command
6. Lastly, run file name with command dotnet run ConsoleCreatures.cs
